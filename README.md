# Math-Riddle-Generator-with-Fine-Tuning

This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-2 model on a custom dataset of math riddles. 
The aim is to train the model to generate creative and contextually relevant math riddles, enhancing 
its ability to understand and produce domain-specific language. It includes data preprocessing, model 
configuration, training using the `transformers` library by Hugging Face, and text generation examples. 
Ideal for AI enthusiasts exploring natural language generation in niche domains like educational content 
and puzzle creation.
